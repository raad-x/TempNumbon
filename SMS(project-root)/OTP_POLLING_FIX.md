# OTP Polling Issue Fix - August 14, 2025

## Problem Summary

The Ring4 SMS verification bot was experiencing an issue where OTP codes were not being delivered to users via Telegram, even though the codes were appearing on the SMSPool website. The bot logs showed:

```
2025-08-14 21:50:06,569 - src.smspool_api - INFO - get_order_status:660 - 🔄 Mapped status 3 -> cancelled
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **status mapping** within `src/smspool_api.py`. The bot was incorrectly mapping SMSPool status code `3` to `'cancelled'`, but based on the fact that OTPs eventually arrived on the website, status code `3` is actually an intermediate processing state, not a terminal cancelled state.

### Incorrect Status Mapping (Before Fix)

```python
status_mapping = {
    1: 'pending',      # SMS not received yet
    2: 'success',      # SMS received successfully
    3: 'cancelled',    # ❌ WRONG - Order cancelled
    4: 'expired',      # Order expired
    5: 'timeout',      # Order timed out
    6: 'cancelled',    # Order cancelled/refunded
}
```

### Correct Status Mapping (After Fix)

```python
status_mapping = {
    1: 'pending',      # SMS not received yet
    2: 'success',      # SMS received successfully
    3: 'processing',   # ✅ CORRECT - SMS dispatched/processing
    4: 'expired',      # Order expired
    5: 'timeout',      # Order timed out
    6: 'cancelled',    # Order cancelled/refunded
}
```

## Impact of the Bug

1. **Polling Continuation**: The polling loop only stops for:

   - Successful OTP receipt (`status == 'success'` AND SMS content exists)
   - Timeout reached
   - Exceptions occurred

2. **No Terminal Status Handling**: There was no explicit handling to stop polling for `'cancelled'` status, so even with the wrong mapping, polling would continue.

3. **Confusing Logs**: The incorrect mapping led to confusing log messages that made debugging difficult.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Status Mapping (`src/smspool_api.py`)

- Changed status `3` from `'cancelled'` to `'processing'`
- Updated valid status list to include `'processing'`

### 2. Enhanced Polling Logic (`main.py`)

- Added specific logging for `'processing'` status transitions
- Added terminal status handling for `'cancelled'`, `'expired'`, `'timeout'`
- Added proper user notifications for terminal states
- Added warning logging for unknown statuses

### 3. Updated Status Display

- Added processing status emoji: `'processing': '🔄'`
- Enhanced status change logging with emojis

### 4. Added Terminal Status Handling

Now the bot properly handles terminal statuses by:

- Stopping polling immediately
- Updating database status
- Notifying user with appropriate message and refund options

## Files Modified

1. `/src/smspool_api.py` - Fixed status mapping
2. `/main.py` - Enhanced polling logic and terminal status handling
3. `/test_status_mapping.py` - Created test script

## Testing

Created and ran test script to verify the fix works correctly.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Status 3 will be correctly identified as `'processing'`
2. ✅ Polling will continue for `'processing'` status (allowing OTP to arrive)
3. ✅ Better logging will show processing state transitions
4. ✅ Terminal statuses will properly stop polling and notify users
5. ✅ OTPs should now be delivered successfully to Telegram users

## Monitoring

Watch for these log patterns after deployment:

- `🔄 Order X is now processing - SMS dispatched, waiting for delivery`
- `🎯 OTP delivered for order X in Y.Zs after N polls`
- No more incorrect `status 3 -> cancelled` mappings

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the quick rollback is to change line in `src/smspool_api.py`:

```python
3: 'processing',   # Change back to 'cancelled' if needed
```

But this should not be necessary as the fix addresses the core issue.
